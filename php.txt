Q1-->a 
List 3 advantages of user define function in programming language.And write a php program to find the largest value among 3 numbers.
	Code Reusability: User-defined functions allow for code to be reused multiple times within a program, reducing redundancy.
	Modularity: By breaking down a program into smaller, manageable pieces, it becomes easier to understand, debug, and test.
	Abstraction: Functions provide a way to abstract complex operations behind a simple interface.
	<?php
    		$num1 = 10;
    		$num2 = 25;
    		$num3 = 15;
    		if($num1 > $num2){
        		if($num1 > $num3){
        	    		echo "Largest number is : $num1 ";
        		}else{
            			echo "Largest number is : $num3 ";
        		}
    		}else{
        		if($num2 > $num3){
            			echo "Largest number is : $num2 ";
        		}else{
            			echo "Largest number is : $num3 ";
        		}
    		}
	?>


Q1-->b 
	<?php
    		$result = array(
        			array(
            				array("Name","Subject1","Subject2"),
            				array("A",75,88),
            				array("B",77,80),
            				array("C",78,90)
        			)
    			);
    		$studentC = $result[0][3];
    		echo "Result of student C are : $studentC[1],$studentC[2]";
	?>

Q1-->c 
	The primary reason an end user cannot see the PHP code when visiting a website built with PHP is that PHP is a server-side scripting language. This means that PHP code is executed on the server before the web page is sent to the user's web browser.

Q2-->a
	A PHP session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages in a web application. Unlike cookies, the information is not stored on the user's computer but on the server, which makes it more secure.
	<?php
    		session_start();
    		$_SESSION["user"] = "Miraz";
    		$_SESSION["mail"] = "miraz@gmail.com";
    
    		echo $_SESSION["user"]." is using this site.";
    
    		unset($_SESSION["user"]);
    		if(!isset($_SESSION["user"])){
        		echo "session unset successful";
    		}
	?>

Q2-->b
	Web security is an essential aspect of modern web development and maintenance, aimed at protecting web applications and their users from a variety of threats. By implementing robust security measures, adhering to best practices, and staying informed about emerging threats, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure the safety and integrity of their online services.
Q2-->c
	<?php
    		$file = 'myfile.txt';
    		if (file_exists($file)) {
        		$file_o = fopen($file, 'r');
        		if ($file_o) {
            			while (($line = fgets($file_o)) !== false) {
                			echo $line . "<br>";
            			}
            			fclose($file_o);
        		} else {
            			echo "Error: Unable to open the file.";
        		}
    		} else {
        		echo "Error: File does not exist.";
    		}
	?>

Q3-->a
	Long-Term Storage:Remembering user preferences or login details.
	Cross-Session Persistence:Keeping users logged in across browser sessions.
	Reducing Server Load:Offloading data storage to the client to reduce server resource usage.

	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
 		userId int(50) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 		username varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 		password varchar(50) NOT NULL,
 		reg_date datetime NOT NULL

	<?php
  $conn = mysqli_connect("localhost:3306","root","","mydb");
  if (mysqli_connect_errno()){
    echo "Failed to connect to database";
  }

    if($res){
        echo "Student Added";

Q5-->a
	The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. Data sent by the GET method is appended to the URL as query strings.
	The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. Data sent by the POST method goes through the HTTP message body, not the URL.
	The REQUEST method is a superglobal array that contains data from both $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE. It is a combination of these three superglobal arrays.

Q5-->b
	MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern widely used in web development to separate concerns within an application. This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and scale applications by dividing the application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.
	Model:Interacts with the database and manages data operations.
	View :Manages the user interface and presentation.
	Controller: Processes user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.
